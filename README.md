# Mini Project 11. PySpark Data Processing

For this project I used Azure Databricks to load and analyse data from one of Databricks preloaded datasets: Songs. I created the Ingest, Prepare and Analyze notebooks to organize and set the workflow. The magic* feature was used within the notebooks to not change the preset language.
